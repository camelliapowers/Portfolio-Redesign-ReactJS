                                I reimagined the user experience as part of a rewrite of the existing product. I was part of the migration from the old product
                                in Flex to the new HTML application (Single-page Application). I worked alongside the development
                                team during the redesign and also helped maintain the user interface for the legacy Flex
                                product. In addition, I collaborated with marketing team to rebrand the look and feel of
                                the product and provided design work such as logo design.
